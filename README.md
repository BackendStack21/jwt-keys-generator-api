This project allows Web browser and API clients to easily generate JWT signing/verification keys supported by the [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) library. The following algorithms are currently supported:

| alg Parameter Value | Digital Signature or MAC Algorithm                                     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HS256               | HMAC using SHA-256 hash algorithm                                      |
| HS384               | HMAC using SHA-384 hash algorithm                                      |
| HS512               | HMAC using SHA-512 hash algorithm                                      |
| RS256               | RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256 hash algorithm                         |
| RS384               | RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-384 hash algorithm                         |
| RS512               | RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-512 hash algorithm                         |
| PS256               | RSASSA-PSS using SHA-256 hash algorithm (only node ^6.12.0 OR >=8.0.0) |
| PS384               | RSASSA-PSS using SHA-384 hash algorithm (only node ^6.12.0 OR >=8.0.0) |
| PS512               | RSASSA-PSS using SHA-512 hash algorithm (only node ^6.12.0 OR >=8.0.0) |
| ES256               | ECDSA using P-256 curve and SHA-256 hash algorithm                     |
| ES384               | ECDSA using P-384 curve and SHA-384 hash algorithm                     |
| ES512               | ECDSA using P-521 curve and SHA-512 hash algorithm                     |

## Considerations:
* For `RS*` and `PS*` algorithms, RSA keys are generated. The key size can be 1024, 2048, 3072 or 4096 bits. 
* For `HS*` keys, there is only private key (aka `secret`) and it is randomly generated using OpenSSL. 
* All keys are expected to be generated on the backend using `OpenSSL` to increase security. 

## Frontend 
- Official URL: https://jwt-keys.21no.de/ (COMING SOON)

## Backend API
- Official URL: `https://jwt-keys.21no.de/api/generate/:ALGORITHM?bytes=BYTES&bits=BITS`

### Examples:
- Generate RS256 key pair: https://jwt-keys.21no.de/api/generate/RS256?bits=2048
- Generate PS256 key pair: https://jwt-keys.21no.de/api/generate/PS256?bits=2048
- Generate HS256 key pair: https://jwt-keys.21no.de/api/generate/HS256?bytes=32
- Generate ES512 key pair: https://jwt-keys.21no.de/api/generate/ES512

### Parameters
#### bytes (optional)
For HMAC (HS*) secret keys, we need to pass the number of random bytes to be generated. 
Supported values: bytes >= 12 && bytes <= 160

The `bytes` query parameter is optional and only used for HS* algorithms. Default value is: 32

#### bits (optional)
> See: https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/2080
Supported values, one of: 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096

The `bits` query parameter is optional and only used for RS* and PS* algorithms. Default value is: 3072

# Run it using Docker
Docker image is publicly available so you can run it on your own infrastructure:
```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 kyberneees/jwt-keys-generator-api:latest
```
